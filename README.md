# Leadlet-Challenge

1.	Title: Module 15 Challenge-Earthquake Visualization
2.	Description: The focus of the Module 15 Challenge is to develop an Earthquake Visualization.

The following are the key areas covered:
  I.	Create an Earthquake Visualization: 
  II.	Obtain the earthquake dataset from the USGS website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php¬)
  III.	Use the representative URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.
  IV.	Import and visualize the data:

3.	Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
  a.	Set data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
  b.	Higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
  c.	Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake
  d.	Create a legend that will provide context for your map data
4.	Usage
  a) The Module 15 Earthquake Visualization-Leaflet Challenge file will have a Leaflet Part 1 folder that contains the static folder that includes a style.js, index, login.js, and README file. 
  b) In order to achieve the coding outputs described above, the script sequencing for the Earthquake Visualization-Challenge requirements are as follows: 
    i.	HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
        a.	To provide the basic structure (index.html)
    ii.	CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
        a.	Established the visual appearance of the webpage that controls the layout and appearance of the map.
    iii.	JavaScript:
        a.	Enables the interactivity and dynamic content handling.  Contains the code the fetches and processes the earthquake data.

5.	Dependencies 
  a. Using the correct html files 
  b. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json
  c. Create functions in JavaScript 
  d. Create, update, and iterate JavaScript objects 

6.	Known Issues: Issues with the script. a. There were no know issues with the script that I am aware of.

8.	Resources:
  a) The code source for this Challenge assignment is based on assistance and debugging from our TA-Javier, Peer-Michael Andies, and the use of Xpert Learning Assistent and ChatGPT.
9.	Version History – Version 1
